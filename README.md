# Retail Customer Segmentation and Demand Forecasting üõçÔ∏è

This project focuses on **forecasting weekly retail sales** using historical transaction data from an online retail store. The goal is to provide accurate sales predictions to support critical business decisions such as **inventory planning**, **resource allocation**, and **sales strategy**. The project leverages the **Facebook Prophet** library for robust time series forecasting and **Plotly** for rich, interactive data visualization.

***

## üìä Project Overview

The core objective is to transform raw sales data into actionable weekly forecasts. By accurately predicting future demand, the business can minimize stock-outs, reduce holding costs, and optimize operational efficiency.

### Key Technologies

* **Forecasting:** Facebook Prophet
* **Visualization:** Plotly
* **Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)

***

## üíæ Dataset

The analysis is based on a cleaned version of transactional data from an online retail store.

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Cleaned_OnlineRetail.csv` | Contains cleaned and preprocessed transactional data including `InvoiceDate` and aggregated `TotalSales`. |
| `Weekly_Sales_Forecast.csv` | Contains the final forecast results generated by Prophet, including predicted sales (`yhat`) and confidence intervals (`yhat_lower`, `yhat_upper`). |

**Note on Data:** The full, original dataset is not included in this repository due to its large size. The project utilizes a cleaned, preprocessed subset.

**You can find the original data on Kaggle:** [Online Retail Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carriezhang/ecommerce-data) (Link to the specific Kaggle dataset you are using should be inserted here).

## ‚ú® Features and Methodology

The project structure and methodology are designed for a streamlined forecasting and reporting workflow.

### Forecasting Pipeline

1.  **Data Preprocessing:** Aggregation of sales data on a **weekly basis** for more granular and stable time series analysis.
2.  **Prophet Model:** Utilizing **Facebook Prophet** to model the time series, effectively capturing underlying **trends** and **seasonal effects** (e.g., yearly, quarterly).
3.  **Model Evaluation:** Calculation of standard accuracy metrics to assess the forecast's performance:
    * **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
    * **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
    * **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

### Interactive Visualization

A core feature is the creation of an interactive dashboard using **Plotly**, which allows stakeholders to easily explore the results:

* **Interactive Chart:** Displays the forecast line, its confidence intervals, and an overlay of the actual historical sales.
* **Time Period Zoom:** Includes a **range slider** and quick-select buttons to zoom into specific time periods (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, all data).
* **Exportable Dashboard:** The visualization is exported as a standalone **HTML dashboard** (`Weekly_Sales_Forecast_Dashboard.html`), allowing anyone to view and interact with the results without needing Python, Jupyter notebooks, or BI tools like Power BI.
