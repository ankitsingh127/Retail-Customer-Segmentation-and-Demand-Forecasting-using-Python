# Retail-Customer-Segmentation-and-Demand-Forecasting-using-Python
Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting weekly retail sales using historical transaction data from an online retail store. The goal is to provide accurate sales predictions to support business decisions such as inventory planning, resource allocation, and sales strategy. The project leverages Facebook Prophet for time series forecasting and Plotly for interactive data visualization.

Dataset
Cleaned_OnlineRetail.csv: Contains cleaned and preprocessed transactional data including InvoiceDate and TotalSales.
Weekly_Sales_Forecast.csv: Contains the forecast results generated by Prophet, including predicted sales and confidence intervals (yhat, yhat_lower, yhat_upper).
Features
Aggregation of sales data on a weekly basis for more granular forecasting.

Forecasting using Prophet to capture trends and seasonal effects.

Calculation of accuracy metrics:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
Interactive visualization with Plotly:

Forecast line
Confidence intervals
Actual sales overlay
Range slider to zoom into specific time periods (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, all data)
Exportable HTML dashboard for sharing results without requiring Python or Power BI.

Note- Full dataset is not included due to size.
Use Kaggle for dataset.
